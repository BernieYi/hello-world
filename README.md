# hello-world
the first repository created to learn GitHub
Hi Everyone,

I am going to created a mutilmedia appication for my daughter(s)' sports team where team members can upload/share team pictures, videos, highlights, etc in stage one.  In stage two, some team management functions will be added such as messaging board, calendar.
